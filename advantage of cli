The cli is a highly effective tool as opposed to the gui for a number of reasons. One of the cli's greatest strengthens lies in its scripting capabilities, which allows users to create automated workflows and perform tasks. Users can design custom solutions that cater to their needs and enhance their productivity and consistency across various operations. 

It also supports of pipelines is a great access for data processing and system administration tasks. This allows users to chain together commands, pass data from one operation to another, resulting in streamlined workflows. This comes in handy when dealing with large datasets. 

In my opinion the fact that the Command-line Interface focuses on efficiency of system resources is one of the top reasons why users should choose CLI. CLI tools resource efficiency make it ideal for tasks in resource-constrained environments and headless servers.
