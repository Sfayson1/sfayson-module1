The CLI is a highly effective tool as opposed to the GUI for a number of reasons. One of the CLI's greatest strengthens lies in its scripting capabilities, which allows users to create automated workflows and perform tasks. Users can design custom solutions that cater to their needs and enhance their productivity and consistency across various operations. 

It also supports of pipelines is a great access for data processing and system administration tasks. This allows users to chain together commands, pass data from one operation to another, resulting in streamlined workflows. This comes in handy when dealing with large datasets. 

In my opinion the fact that the Command-line Interface focuses on efficiency of system resources is one of the top reasons why users should choose CLI. As a programmer this is the most essential tool. It allows me to save resources for when I need them most like when I need to run programs. Another thing that it's great for is version control. It helps me keep track of changes in my code base and collaborating with others. Being able to keep track of changes while in the middle of development is invaluable.
