The command line interface is a text based user interface that is resource efficient. CLI commands can be automated and scripted to allow users to create and reuse automated scripts for many different tasks. It uses fewer system resources making it resourceful for remote or resource constrained environments. Some limitations that may present themselves when using the CLI is that there is a steep learning curve when attempting to learn the varies commands. The command may also vary based on the type of cli environment being used. Another limitation is the fact the lack of accessibility, because the cli is text based it presents some limitations for users with disabilities.

The graphical user interface (GUI) on the other hand is a graphics based interface that visual elements for user interaction. It is user friendly, reducing the need to memorize commands. It allows for visual feedback which provides users with immediate feedback when an action is performed. It also allows user to interact directly with the interface through the use of buttons, icons, and clicking actions. Users can work in multiple applications and windows simultaneously. Unlike the cli it offers the benefits of accessibility of screen readers and keyboard navigation to accommodate users with disabilities. Some limitations that a user might experience is the requirement of more memory and processing power compared to cli. It does not allow for automation unlike cli. Most importantly users will find that they are limited in the amount of control they may over the system.
