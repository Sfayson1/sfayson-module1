# Utilize the command history effectively
In the first exercise, I used the Up arrow to navigate through previously used commands to execute the `ps u` command.

In the second exercise, I used the `!!` command to run the previously used command. 

In exercise 3 I navigated to the directory module-one-practice. Then I used the command `cd ..` to navigate back to the parent directory. 
Then I executed the `cd !$` which executes `cd ..` when sends me to the home directory. 

In exercise four I executed the `history` command which listed all of the commands executed. I then executed the command `!238` 238 is the number in of the command in the history list.
