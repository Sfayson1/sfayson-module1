# Monitor system processes using commands like `ps`

In the image below you see that I used the command `ps a`. This command lists currently running processes for all users. 

The next command we used was `ps u` this command lists all currently running processes by a user.

The final command that was used was `ps aux | grep chrome` this command finds and lists all processes by the name of chrome.
