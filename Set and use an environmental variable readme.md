##  Create a temporary alias for a long or complex command you use frequently
Because I do not have long or complex commands that I use often. I chose to use `cd ..` the command that I would create an alias for.

## Make your alias persistent by adding it to your shellâ€™s configuration file
In the image below we opened our `.bashrc` file to add our alias to the file in order for it to be persistent.
We ran the command `back` again to make sure that the command still works as expected.

## Source your shell configuration file to apply the new alias without restarting it, or simply open a new shell to test it.
In the image below you see we tested the command to confirm that it still executed the command as expected.
