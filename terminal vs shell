The terminal is a physical or software-based interface through which users can communicate with their computer. It serves as a workspace where users can enter text-based commands and receive outputs.

The shell is the command interpreter within the command-line environment. It acts as the middleman between the user and the operating system. When a user enters a command in the terminal, the shell takes the command, interprets it, executes it by interacting with the operating system, and returns the result to the terminal for the user to see.
