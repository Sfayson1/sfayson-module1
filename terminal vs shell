The terminal is a software-based interface that users use to interact with their computer. It accepts the input and sends it to the shell for processing and displays the output result for the user to see. 

The shell is the command processor that interprets the commands that we input into the terminal and talks directly to the computer's operating system to execute the commands. It can also runs scripts which allow automation of tasks.
