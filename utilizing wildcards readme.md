I used the * wildcard to list all that had a .txt file extension.

Next I used the ? wildcard to search and list file names with practical and ? for the ending character. 

Then I created files name file1 through 5 then I listed file1 through 3 with one command prompt.

In the final command prompt I used ? and * wildcard to search for files whose name fit the description provided.
