To open a text file in nano the following command must be executed.
`nano filename.txt`, then you can add text at the position of the cursor. As seen in the image below used `ctrl+0` to save my changes

You can delete text by using the backspace/delete key to delete characters from the left of the cursor position or using `Ctrl+K` to
delete all the text from the cursor position to the end of the line. In the screenshot below I use `ctrl+K` to delete all of text

To edit a text using vi. You simply type `vi filename.txt` To edit the text file you must be in insert mode. press `i` to enter insert mode and  make the changes to the file.
to exit insert mode press `ESC` and type `:wq` This will save your changes and exit vi.

emacs is the most customizable for the three editors. This is a tool for more advanced users. Nano is for someone who wants a simple editor that is simple and easy to use
While Vi is in the middle of the two. It's highly efficient and easy to use if the user is willing to invest the time to learn how to use it.
