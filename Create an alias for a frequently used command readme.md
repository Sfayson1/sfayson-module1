# Create an alias for a frequently used command

##  Create a Temporary Alias
In the image below, I used the command `alias ll='ls -l'` that creates an alias named ll that will execute the command ls -l when used.

## Make Your Alias Persistent
In the image below we opened our `.bashrc` file to add our alias to the file in order for it to be persistent.
We ran the command `ll` again to make sure that the command still works as expected.
