In the image below I have a directory you see that I used the mv command to move the file named copy to my practice directory. 
I then use mv again to rename the file practice to spiderman.
rm was used to delete the file named me from the directory.

Now in this image I used the cp command to copy the file module-one-practice to the parent directory module-one-practice.
